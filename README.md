# NeuroScanX
Multi-modal medical imaging AI using PyTorch for early disease detection, featuring a memory-efficient tensor pipeline, custom datasets, and clinically aware evaluation for real-world use.

# Current
- Medical Images extracted from the files and converted into nested variables
- Medical Images are separated into Medical Train and Medical Test
- Using `matplotlib.pyplot`, Images have been generated visually in `main.iypnb`
- Structures of Nested Variable has been loaded into the notebook.

# Next Task
- Updating `vectorimg()` function
- Initiation (Early) to Machine learning algorithm
